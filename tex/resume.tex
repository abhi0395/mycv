\textcolor{sectionblue}{\textbf{\underline{Data Engineering, ML and Big Data}}}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
    \item Built and deployed scalable \textbf{large-scale predictive modeling pipeline} (\href{https://github.com/desihub/redrock}{\textit{redrock}}, multi-class classification; PCA feature engineering) on ~60M+ records, improving accuracy by 30\% and cutting false positives by 30\%.
    \item Designed controlled experiments to compare modeling approaches, analogous to A/B testing to guide data driven method selection. Also performed model evaluation metrics (ROC-AUC, precision-recall, etc).

    \item Designed \textbf{distributed real-time I/O pipelines (FITS, HDF5) to process 5+ TB/day, $\approx$100k rows/min} of structured and unstructured data, optimized for analytics in Python/pandas and SQL. Architecture is transferable to cloud-based systems (e.g., GCP, AWS).
    \item Developed and maintained \textbf{internal/external analysis libraries (open source)}, leading features, code reviews, and model improvements, and reporting workflows. Improved software quality via automated tests (unittest), documentation, and supporting reproducible analytics at scale.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.5pt}
\textcolor{sectionblue}{\textbf{\underline{Project Leadership and Scientific Impact}}}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
    \item Led \textbf{two cross-functional projects} with 15+ team members, coordinating software and deployment efforts to improve classification performance and reliability, enabling more accurate data driven decisions in a large scale production pipeline.
    \item Proposed and implemented data-driven improvements to production pipelines, securing a successful \textbf{2-year project extension}. Recognized as a top 10\% contributor within the collaboration.
    \item Mentored junior analysts/researchers on experimental design, statistical validation, and production-grade codebases.
    \item Communicated analytical findings to both technical and non-technical audiences to support data driven decisions within a large international scientific collaboration.

\textcolor{sectionblue}{\textbf{\underline{Data Engineering, ML and Big Data}}}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
    \item Built parallel \textbf{signal-processing models (matched-kernel detection)} for large sequential data, raising precision ($\geq95\%$ purity) and reducing runtime from weeks to hours on ~1M+ samples
    \item Developed and accelerated \textbf{non-linear regression pipelines (with Numba)} for parameter estimation, with rigorous model testing/validation and performance analysis.
    \item Ran large-scale statistical validation (hypothesis testing, bootstrapping) and experiment design to quantify uncertainty and build models.
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{sectionblue}{\textbf{\underline{Project Leadership and Scientific Impact}}}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
   \item Led \textbf{two large research projects}, from concept to publication, resulting in high-purity data products used by \textbf{50+ research teams worldwide.}
    \item Collaborated with computational physicists \textbf{to merge observational and simulated datasets}, enabling new insights into the physical origins of detected patterns.
