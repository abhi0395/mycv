\section*{Work Experience}

\textbf{Postdoctoral Fellow } \hfill \textit{Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Berkeley, USA} \hfill \textit{Sep 2022 – Present} 
\begin{itemize}

    \item Led 2 cross-functional projects across science and analysis teams (15+ members); reduced false positives by 10–30\% and improved model success by 1–5\%, impacting hundreds of thousands of objects.

    \item Designed and deployed scalable data pipelines on HPC systems (\href{https://www.nersc.gov/}{NERSC}/Slurm) to process 50+ TB of structured and unstructured data; automated final mathematical model construction for real-time use.

     \item Contributed to open-source repositories (e.g., \href{https://github.com/desihub/redrock}{redrock}), a core component of large-scale projects like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Energy_Spectroscopic_Instrument}{DESI}, which is building the largest 3D map of the Universe.

    \item Mentored 3 graduate researchers, supporting analysis of simulated and real data using data science methods.
    
    \end{itemize}
    
\vspace{2mm}
\textbf{Max Planck PhD Fellow} \hfill \textit{Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, Garching, Germany} \hfill \textit{Sep 2018 – Jul 2022} 
\begin{itemize}

    \item Developed a parallelized feature detection system to analyze 1M+ high-dimensional datasets, cutting manual review time from weeks to hours and improving detection rate by 5-10x.

    \item Released open-source catalogs and tools (project: \href{https://github.com/abhi0395/qsoabsfind}{qsoabsfind}) used by 30+ external research groups for scientific analysis.

    \item Applied PCA/NMF for dimensionality reduction and feature detection, improving signal clarity and method performance.

    \item Built automated data wrangling pipelines, reducing preprocessing time and manual steps by 70-80\%.
