\section*{Work and Research Experience}

\textcolor{sectionblue}{\textbf{Postdoctoral Fellow }} \hfill \textcolor{sectionblue}{\textit{Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, USA}} \hfill \textcolor{sectionblue}{\textit{Sep 2022 – Present}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built and deployed \textbf{ML based data pipelines on HPC} systems (\href{https://www.nersc.gov/}{NERSC}/Slurm) to process 50+ TB of structured and unstructured data; \textbf{automated model generation for real-time classification pipelines used in large-scale surveys.}
    \vspace*{-1mm}
    \item Led 2 cross-functional projects across science and analysis teams (15+ members); \textbf{reduced false positives by 10–30\%} and improved \textbf{true positive rates by 1–5\%}, impacting hundreds of thousands of objects.
    \vspace*{-1mm}
     \item \textbf{Contributed to open-source repositories} (e.g., \href{https://github.com/desihub/redrock}{redrock}), a core component of large-scale projects like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Energy_Spectroscopic_Instrument}{DESI}, which is building the largest 3D map of the Universe.
    \vspace*{-1mm}
    \item Mentored 2 graduate researchers in simulation workflows and data analysis that is leading to high-impact publications.

\begin{itemize}

    \item Developed a parallelized feature algorithm that \textbf{improved detection by a factor of 5-10 and increased the signal purity to $\gtrsim 95\%$}, reducing runtime from weeks to hours, \textbf{impacting millions of high-dimensional datasets.}
    \vspace*{-1mm}
    \item Released open-source catalogs and tools (project: \href{https://github.com/abhi0395/qsoabsfind}{qsoabsfind}) used \textbf{by 30+ external research groups} for scientific analysis.
    \vspace*{-1mm}
    \item Applied PCA/NMF for dimensionality reduction for mathematical modeling of features and \textbf{improved signal clarity and method performance by a factor of 2-5}.
    \vspace*{-1mm}
  \item Built automated data wrangling pipelines, \textbf{reducing preprocessing time by a factor of 10.}
